\begin{abstract}
While the Internet is increasingly mobile, seamless mobility is
difficult to implement at Internet scale.  Over the years, standards
bodies and the research community have introduced a large and
confusing collection of mobility proposals that are difficult to
compare.  In this tutorial, we present these mobility proposals
in a uniform framework, called the geomorphic view of networking.
The geomorphic view shows that there are two distinct patterns
for implementing mobility, each with its own range of 
design choices and cost-benefit trade-offs.
We use these patterns to classify and explain
a representative sample of mobility
mechanisms, abstractly yet precisely.
The patterns also serve as a basis for evaluating properties of
these mechanisms such as resource costs and scalability,
and for considering composition of mobility mechanisms.
