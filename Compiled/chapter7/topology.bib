  abstract	= {The origin-destination (OD) traffic matrix of a computer
		  network is useful for solving problems in design, routing,
		  configuration debugging, monitoring, and pricing. Directly
		  measuring this matrix is not usually feasible, but less
		  informative link measurements are easy to obtain. This work
		  studies the inference of OD byte counts from link byte
		  counts measured at router interfaces under a fixed routing
		  scheme. A basic model of the OD counts assumes that they
		  are independent normal over OD pairs and iid over
		  successive measurement periods. The normal means and
		  variances are functionally related through a power law. We
		  deal with the time-varying nature of the counts by fitting
		  the basic iid model locally using a moving data window.
		  Identifiability of the model is proved for router link data
		  and maximum likelihood is used for parameter estimation.
		  The OD counts are estimated by their conditional
		  expectations given the link counts and estimated
		  parameters. Thus, OD estimates are forced to be positive
		  and to harmonize with the link count measurements and the
		  routing scheme. Finally, maximum likelihood estimation is
		  improved by using an adaptive prior. Proposed methods are
		  applied to two simple networks at Lucent Technologies and
		  found to perform well. Furthermore, the estimates are
		  validated in a single-router network for which direct
		  measurements of origin-destination counts are available
		  through special software.},

  abstract	= {Considerable attention has been focused on the properties
		  of graphs derived from Internet measurements. Router-level
		  topologies collected via traceroute studies have led some
		  authors to conclude that the router graph of the Internet
		  is a scale-free graph, or more generally a power-law random
		  graph. In such a graph, the degree distribution of nodes
		  follows a distribution with a power-law tail. In this paper
		  we argue that the evidence to date for this conclusion is
		  at best insufficient. We show that graphs appearing to have
		  power-law degree distributions can arise surprisingly
		  easily, when sampling graphs whose true degree distribution
		  is not at all like a power-law. For example, given a
		  classical Erdos-Renyi sparse, random graph, the subgraph
		  formed by a collection of shortest paths from a small set
		  of random sources to a larger set of random destinations
		  can easily appear to show a degree distribution remarkably
		  like a power-law. We explore the reasons for how this
		  effect arises, and show that in such a setting, edges are
		  sampled in a highly biased manner. This insight allows us
		  to distinguish measurements taken from the Erdos-Renyi
		  graphs from those taken from power-law random graphs. When
		  we apply this distinction to a number of well-known
		  datasets, we find that the evidence for sampling bias in
		  these datasets is strong.}

@Article{	  rudelson05,
  abstract	= {We develop an approach through geometric functional
		  analysis to reconstruction of signals from few linear
		  measurements and to error-correcting codes. An
		  error-correcting code encodes an n-letter word x into an
		  m-letter word y in such a way that x can be decoded
		  correctly when any r letters of y are corrupted. We show
		  that most linear orthogonal transformations Q : [R]n
		  [-&gt;] [R]m form efficient and robust error-correcting
		  codes over reals. The decoder (which corrects the corrupted
		  components of y) is the metric projection onto the range of
		  Q in the {ell}1-norm. This yields robust error-correcting
		  codes over reals (and over alphabets of polynomial size),
		  with a Gilbert-Varshamov type bound, and with quadratic
		  time encoders and polynomial time decoders. An equivalent
		  problem arises in signal processing: how to reconstruct a
		  signal that belongs to a small class from few linear
		  measurements? We prove that for most sets of Gaussian
		  measurements, all signals of small support can be exactly
		  reconstructed by the L1-norm minimization. This is an
		  improvement of recent results of Donoho and of Candes and
		  Tao. An equivalent problem in combinatorial geometry is the
		  existence of "neighborly" symmetric polytopes, that is,
		  polytopes with fixed number of facets and maximal number of
		  lower-dimensional facets. We prove that most sections of a
		  cube form such polytopes. Our work thus belongs to a common
		  ground of coding theory, signal processing, combinatorial
		  geometry, and geometric functional analysis. Our argument,
		  which is based on concentration of measure and improving
		  Lipschitzness by random projections, may be of independent
		  interest in geometric functional analysis. },
