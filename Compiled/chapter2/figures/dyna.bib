        abstract = "
The best-effort nature of the Internet poses a significant obstacle to
  the deployment of many applications that require guaranteed
  bandwidth. In this paper, we present a novel approach that enables
  two edge/border routers---which we call Internet Traffic Managers
  (ITM)---to use an adaptive number of TCP connections to set up a
  tunnel of desirable bandwidth between them.  The number of TCP
  connections that comprise this tunnel is elastic in the sense that
  it increases/decreases in tandem with competing cross traffic to
  maintain a target bandwidth.  An origin ITM would then schedule
  incoming packets from an application requiring guaranteed bandwidth
  over that elastic tunnel. Unlike many proposed solutions that aim to
  deliver soft QoS guarantees, our elastic-tunnel approach does {\em
  not} require any support from core routers (as with IntServ and
  DiffServ); it is scalable in the sense that core routers do not have
  to maintain per-flow state (as with IntServ); and it is readily
  deployable within a single ISP or across multiple ISPs. To evaluate
  our approach, we develop a flow-level control-theoretic model to
  study the transient behavior of established elastic TCP-based
  tunnels.  The model captures the effect of cross-traffic connections
  on our bandwidth allocation policies.  Through extensive
  simulations, we confirm the effectiveness of our approach in
  providing soft bandwidth guarantees.
