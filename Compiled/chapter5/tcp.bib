ABSTRACT="We investigate the performance of TCP connections over ATM 
networks without ATM-level congestion control, and compare it to the  
performance of TCP over packet-based networks. For simulations of  
congested networks, the effective throughput of TCP over ATM can be
quite low when cells are dropped at the congested ATM switch. The low     
throughput is due to wasted bandwidth as the congested links transmits  
cells from 'corrupted' packets, i.e., packets in wich at least one cell
is drooped by the switch. This fragmentation effect can be corrected and
high throughput can be achieved if the switch drops whole packets prior 
to buffer overflow; we call this strategy Early Packet Discard. We
also discuss general issues of congestion avoidance for best-effort
traffic in ATM networks.",

Several research efforts have aimed at developing additions to ATM networks like Early Packet
Discard that avoid TCP throughput degradation. This paper instead investigates improvements to
TCP that allow it to perform well on ATM networks without switch-level enhancements, thus
avoiding additional complexity and loss of layer transparency in ATM switches. We present an
enhanced version of TCP Vegas and show that it performs nearly as well on plain ATM networks
as on packet-oriented networks. Moreover, like the original TCP Vegas, our version achieves a
significant increase in throughput over the BSD 4.4-Lite TCP. We also present an analysis of
TCP dynamics over ATM networks, and a simulation based study of the various enhancements in
our TCP implementation and their impact on TCP performance over ATM and packet-oriented
networks.}

  ABSTRACT = {ATM-UBR switches respond to congestion by dropping cells when their
   buffers become full. TCP connections running over UBR experience low
   throughput and high unfairness. For 100\% TCP throughput each switch 
   needs buffers equal to the sum of the window sizes of all the TCP
   connections. Intelligent drop policies can improve the performance of
   TCP over UBR with limited buffers. The UBR+ service proposes       
   enhancements to UBR for intelligent drop. Early Packet Discard     
   improves throughput but does not attempt to improve fairness.      
   Selective packet drop based on per-connection buffer occupancy      
   improves fairness. The Fair Buffer Allocation scheme further improves
   both throughput and fairness. }

TITLE="Shaper Dimensioning for {MAN} to {ATM} based {WAN}",
BOOKTITLE="Interop94 Engineers' Conference",
ADDRESS="Las Vegas, California",
YEAR=1994,
MONTH=may,
URL="http://lrcwww.epfl.ch/PS_files/Interop94.ps",
ABSTRACT="This paper considers the dimensioning of the traffic shaping
buffer in an Interworking Unit used to interconnect DQDB based MANs
over a broadband ATM network.  The first part of the paper presents
and exact solution for the cell loss probability in the shaper, using
an (M/D/1)/D/1/K queueing model.  The second part of the paper
examines the suitability of such Poissonian arrival assumptions, first
based upon simulation using traffic measured from an operational
Ethernet and then from simulations of the TCP flow control algorithm
over the heterogeneous network, with a burst silence model used to
model file transfer traffic (such as that from FTP).  Results show
that the Poissonian model is too optimistic in terms of estimating the
packet loss probability in the shaper.  Results from the TCP
simulations show that small buffer sizes and light loading are
required in order to achieve small mean end-to-end delays.",

ABSTRACT="We consider the performance of TCP/IP over a LAN
interconnection service (such as SMDS) based on ATM.  In order to
achieve a reasonable utilisation of the ATM network and at the same
time guarantee the packet loss probability specified by SMDS, a
shaping buffer is necessary in the MAN to WAN interworking unit. 
Through simulation studies we show that good TCP performance may be
achieved with a shaper size of around 1000 cells.  However, the load
conditions that give optimal TCP performance do not necessarily
coincide with those that satisfy the stringent loss requirements
specified.  Moreover, the shaping buffer introduces delay that is
unacceptable for SMDS.  The conclusion is that stringent delay and
loss guarantees for the interconnection service are not appropriate
for TCP traffic and can only be provided at the cost of low
utilisation of the underlying ATM network.",

the MAGIC gigabit testbed.  In particular, we will focus on results
that indicate that the TCP rate control mechanism alone is inadequate
for congestion avoidance and control in wide-area gigabit networks.
We will also present results showing that TCP augmented by cell-level
pacing addresses these problems and allows the full bandwidth capacity
to be utilized.",
